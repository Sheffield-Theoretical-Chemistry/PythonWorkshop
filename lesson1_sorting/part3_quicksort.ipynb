    "First, we define a base case. Here, our base case is an array of one or zero elements. In other words, if a given array reached the size < 2, we return it. Now, given an array, we pick a value and assign it as the so-called *pivot*. Then, we look at all the remaining elements in an array and divide them into 2 new arrays:\n",

    "1. an array with values smaller than or equal to the pivot\n",
    "2. an array with values greater than the pivot\n",
    "\n",

    "Note that the performance of quicksort is only O(n log n) if the values in the array occur in completely random order. If an array is already sorted, quicksort has time complexity O(n^2) if we would always pick the first value of the array as the pivot like in the implementation above. Why? Because, depending on whether the array is sorted in ascending or descending order, the left or the right subarray in the recursive function will always be empty. Thus, if we have n elements in an array, our call stack will have a depth of n, thus O(n*n) = O(n^2). However, if we always divide the array in half, the call stack will only have depth log n, thus O(n log n). \n",
