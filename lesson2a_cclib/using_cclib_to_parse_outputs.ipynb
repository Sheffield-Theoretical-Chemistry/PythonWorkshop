    "# Using `cclib` to parse quantum chemical outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a calculation is pointless unless we can access the data. It is not only incredibly boring, but error-prone and an innefficient use of time to manually extract data from output files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of reading an output file and transforming the raw data contained within into information is called parsing. The prospect of writing a program to parse output files from scratch, whilst exhilarating, is daunting.\n",
    "Luckily, a lot of people have already done a lot of work for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "The python module [`cclib`](https://www.github.com/cclib/cclib \"cclib on github\") is able to parse a vast number of properties from a wide array of commonly used quantum chemical software, including `Gaussian`, `ORCA`, `Molpro`, `Q-Chem`, and others. A complete list of available properties and compatible software can be found [here](https://cclib.github.io/data.html \"Data & software parsed by cclib\").\n",
    "\n",
    "## Obtaining the package\n",
    "`cclib` is not provided in the Anaconda default installation. We must install it ourselves manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is a bug in the current release of `cclib` that means we need to install a slightly older version of it, version `1.5.3`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Installing with Anaconda Prompt\n",
    "Open the anaconda prompt program and enter the following command\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install -c omnia cclib`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Installing with Anaconda Navigator\n",
    "Follow the instructions on [this page](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/manage-packages/ \"Anaconda Navigator tutorial\"), making sure to install `cclib 1.5.3` specifically.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Installing with pip\n",
    "We can use the command\n",
    "`pip install cclib==1.5.3`\n",
    "alternatively, to obtain the current development version, in which the issue has also been solved\n",
    "`pip install git+https://github.com/cclib/cclib`"
